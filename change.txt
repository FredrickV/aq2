Changes in TNG

+ = new feature
- = bug fix
* = major bug fix

From 2.81
* 3team mode: third team can not be locked forever anymore
- Player can not flood sounds through menu
- Team scores reset at SpawnEntities, so you can use 'gamemap' command for resetting now.
- can't punch teammate anymore when ff is off
- Changing team/sub doesn't decrease frags when hit by teammate and round is over.
* Reloading HC with single barrel. Doesn't minus 2 when only the other shell is fired and you can now reload the last shell when you have only 1 left.
* Matchtime could left running if team is ready and all players is in sub.
- Getting frag when dead dont increase streak count.
- Cant drop anything when dead/spec, should fix issue when dropping weapon at same time you die caused 2 weapons to drop.
- Reports last damaged part as chest when hitted with knife while target was using kevlar west.
- Picking up m3/ssg didnt come with full clip when reloading.
+ radio/menu sounds use svc_sound instead of stuffing "play x.wav"
+ Moved some variables to own struct, so it makes code simpler/shorter.
+ Use direct path to show team skin pics instead of "../pics". This allows those pictures inside pak to work.
+ checking player skins for overflow
+ Made some buffers smaller and using buffer safe copying istead of using huge buffers to make sure all fits
+ removed "use_mapvote" & "use_cvote" from serverinfo. More space for other
+ roundtimeleft now also shows remaining seconds
+ time command now works in matchmode too
+ Doesnt update CS_PLAYERSKINS config string in teamplay when nick or skin havent changed.
+ second mode to Cvar use_mapvote 2, it's same as 1 except it changes to mostvoted map when timelimit/roundlimit hits.
+ "pausegame" command in matchmode. This allow non substitutes to pause game for 1min.
+ "unpausegame" to unpause (who would guess). Only players in same team which paused can unpause.
+ Cvar "mm_pausecount" to define how many times team can pause the game.  When "0" pause is disabled (Default "3").
+ Cvar "mm_pausetime" to define pause time in minutes (default 2)
+ New playing mode: Team Deathmatch with matchmode! Use 'teamdm 1' to enable.
+ Cvar teamdm_respawn to specify respawn time (default 4).
+ cmd 'resetscores' to reset scores in matchmode. The command can be used by matchadmins or captains. When captains are using it, it will need to be accepted by the other captain as well.
+ item_respawn, weapon_respawn & ammo_respawn cvars to define respawn time when dropped. defaults: item 59, weapon 74 & ammo 30.
+ Matchmode support for 3 team and ctf playing modes.
+ Cvar "respawn_effect" to enable effect+sound when respawning in dm/teamdm/ctf.
- Dropping bandolier in teamplay mode used deathmatch values for ammo, so it allowed to drop bandolier and still have some extra ammo.
- Fixed issues when radio death sound get played more than once.
- 'use throwing combat knife' and 'use slashing combat knife' did change the mode when it was the correct mode already.
* 3rd team in 3team mode wont allways spawn to same spot anymore.
+ Removed ALOT string compares for specifying model, instead added new integer for type. This should speed up little bit.
+ In ctf mode, team1 players will only use 'info_player_team1' spawns and team2 'info_player_team2' spawns. If map doesnt have these spawns, it uses random 'info_player_deathmatch' spawn like spectators.
+ cvar 'wave_time' to specify delay between each wave commands in seconds. Default 5
- 'time' command would only work in matchmode.
* Couple of bugs that caused crash.
- Score print at end of match when playing ctf would print 0's as both team scores.
+ Temporary vote banning uses same banning list like normal ban/teamkill bans, so admins can now remove/list them.
+ When temp banned (by teamkilling/vote kick), ban msg says temporary banned and how many games, instead of just "Banned".
+ ammo_respawn cvar also effects to grenade respawn time.
+ Changed CS_PLAYERSKINS update back for now.
+ Changed 'use throwing combat knife" toggle back, seems like some player are used how it was.
+ Disabled some commands when game is paused.
+ dmflags 65536 changes the weapon respawn method in teamd/dm. Now weapons keep respawnning even if weapon is in use. With this setting cvar 'weapon_respawn' controls the respawn time when picked, not dropped.
* Pistols didn't respawn at dm/teamdm.
- Votes now actually work in teamDM during play.
- Disabled config/map voting during intermission. Thus, a player could change map/cfg while mapchange.
* Crashed when client used this game-mod for demo playback.
- Now, it doesn't sound when you're zooming your ssg to same zoom-level using the lens command.
- Multiple lens command during bandage or too fast repeating could do extra annoying zooming.
* Player with last ID didnt show up in ignore menu.
- If you were killing a player only with one last kevlar shot the console message was sent to the player who hit him before.
+ Disabled 'Leave team' menu on non-teamplay mode.
+ Removed spaces from demo name using autorecord.
+ Changed skin _i.pcx pics back using '..' like they were. Client download code didnt like it, though it doesn't like '..' either.
+ Disabled '..' in voice command.
+ 'item_respawnmode' cvar to change how item respawns in dm/teamdm. Normally item would only spawn at random deathmatch spawn.  The new mode disables it and spawns item only if map has a spawn point for this item.
- Remove a few lines of code that broke compiling on Linux
+ Disable MM2 messages displayed as MM1 in DM
+ Disable leg damage sound when falling and fall damage disabled
+ New cvar "motdname" which tells which file to read the MOTD from
+ Better auto joining which calculates the correct team when you select "Auto-join team" from menu rather select the correct menu item for you
